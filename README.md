## Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled images representing various **hand gestures**. It includes:
- **Training Data**: Preprocessed hand gesture images.
- **Test Data**: Used for evaluating model performance.

## Installation

To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. **Load the Dataset**:
   - Ensure the dataset is structured correctly in the working directory.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Convert images to grayscale.
   - Resize images for consistency.
   - Apply edge detection and contour extraction.

3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Extract keypoints using techniques like **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** or **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)**.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Train classifiers such as **SVM, KNN, Random Forest** on extracted features.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Assess model accuracy using precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Example Usage

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import cv2
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC
```

## Model Training

- **Feature Extraction**: Keypoint-based descriptors (HOG, SIFT, ORB)
- **Classification Algorithms**: SVM, Random Forest, KNN
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Results

Key findings from the model training:
- **High accuracy in gesture recognition** with optimized feature extraction.
- **Feature-based ML models** perform well with minimal computational resources.
- **Misclassified gestures analyzed** for potential improvements.
